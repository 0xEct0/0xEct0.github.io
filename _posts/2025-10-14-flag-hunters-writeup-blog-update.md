This past year I have been extremely busy and have accomplished a lot both professionally and personally. For starters, earlier this year I achieved the Red Team Ops (CRTO) certification from Zero-Point Security, and while waiting for CRTOII to release on RastaMouse's new website, I have been working through the Offensive Development Practicioner Course/Certification (ODPC). I haven't finished the ODPC course yet as it's *very* dense material wise, but my thought is to at the very least finish the ODPC course to acquire the knowledge, then do CRTOII course/certification.

Recently, through no fault of the course, I've been feeling a bit burnt out where studying outside of work felt more like a chore rather than out of interest so I've decided to pause on studying ODPC for a bit. 

Presently, I have been in a more "CTF" mood and decided to jump back into CTF grinding and to start off I decided with picoCTF challenges. 

### Flag Runners Walkthrough
A separate professional goal of mine is to also get really good at technical presentations and conveying technical concepts, so I decided to make a video walkthrough. Videos aren't really "presentations" but practicing by going through and talking about technical material *should* help with presentations...

This challenge was a good warmup on walking through some python code and interpreting what it does to find how to manipulate where the program 'jumps' to for it to print the flag.
