I have a MS in Cybersecurity and currently have about three years of experiencing working as a Security Engineer on the Threat Detection/Reverse Engineering team. Specific interests in information security includes anything within red teaming, tooling (software/implant) development, and malware reverse engineering. 

Doing hands-on challenges and activities is my preferred method of learning so you can find write-ups for CTF challenges, HackTheBox challenges, and general lab activities in here. Doing write-ups helps me remember what I learn and it ensures that I fully understand the topic. 

In addition this site will have my security notes in whatever I have learned. Documenting what I learn also helps solidify the information and helps me share what I learned that might be useful to others.

### Personal goals (what this site will probably mostly contain eventually):
- Get good at malware static and dynamic analysis
- Understand how attacking tradecraft works and be able to simulate it
- Develop red team tooling and malware
- Get more familiarized with Windows internals/Windows API
- Document what I learn and continue pursuing whatever I find interesting
